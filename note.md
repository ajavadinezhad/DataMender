Here are all the things mentioned about the **project** specifically:

## Project Overview
- **25% of final grade** (reduced from previous years due to added class participation component)
- **Group work**: 5 students per group maximum, no exceptions
- Work together but each member submits individual completion
- Timeline: ~2 months of work (October, November, part of December)
- **Goal**: Can finish most work by November before Thanksgiving

## Project Proposal Stage

### Presentation Component
- **3 minutes maximum** - timer stops sharply at 3 minutes
- **2 slides plus title slide**:
  - Title slide: Catchy title + group members
  - Slide 1: Background, problem statement, objectives  
  - Slide 2: Expected deliverables and timeline
- **In-person presentation** in class
- Upload PowerPoint to Brightspace named "project proposal-[group number]"
- Use professor's laptop (no personal laptops to minimize setup time)
- Not all group members need to present, but all welcome to attend

### Written Proposal Component
- **2-page limit**
- Due end of next Sunday after presentation
- Must include:
  - Background and motivation
  - Problem statement and why it's important
  - Challenges
  - Solution approach
  - Deliverables and timeline
  - Division of work among group members
- **5% of final grade**

## Final Project Requirements

### Topic Guidelines
- **Must be related to Big Data Systems**
- **AI + X approach encouraged** - apply AI to different domains
- **Use recent topics** (past 3 years) - avoid outdated technologies
- **Concrete and narrow focus is better** than broad topics
- **Utilize large language models extensively**
- Pick **unusual/uncommon areas** for competitive advantage

### What to Avoid
- **No fine-tuning projects** - easy concept but very hard implementation
- Don't pick overly general topics
- Avoid outdated systems like Google File System

### Final Deliverables
- **15-minute recorded presentation** (3 minutes per group member)
- **No synchronized in-class final presentation** due to class size
- Upload recording for professor's grading
- All group members should participate in recorded presentation

## AI Integration Expectations
- **Encouraged to use AI extensively** throughout project
- Use AI for literature review, idea generation, coding assistance
- Learn to work as project manager/product manager with AI
- Focus on providing unique value that AI cannot
- Practice different stages of research process with AI assistance

## Success Criteria
- **Concrete deliverables required** - be specific about what you'll produce
- Narrow down topic quickly (exploration vs exploitation trade-off)
- Consider potential for conference workshop papers/posters
- Should be something you can discuss in job interviews
- Demonstrate teamwork and communication skills

## Professor's Guidance Philosophy
- More concrete/specific = higher likelihood of success
- Workload dictates system design
- Focus on execution quality over topic selection
- Project serves as "playground" for learning and experimentation
- Should contribute something meaningful to society

The professor emphasized that successful projects require early focus, concrete goals, and effective use of AI tools while maintaining human creativity and critical thinking.
